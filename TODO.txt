Allow the sweep_fn to handle mutltiple outputs, and offer the option of ignoring some outputs.

More sensible checking of inputs to stop long time waisting sesions.

Allow for graphical output of more than 3 sweep parameters, by outputting multiple graphs

More exciting examples (the ones I have are a bit boring)

Add the option of repeating multiple times (for stochastic models)
