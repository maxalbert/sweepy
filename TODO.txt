Allow the sweep_fn to handle mutltiple outputs, and offer the option of ignoring some outputs.

More sensible checking of inputs to stop long time waisting sesions

Allow sweep class interface, basically wrap the class into a funcion and send to sweep function.

Allow for graphical output of more than 3 sweep parameters, by outputting mutlpie graphs

Change the graphical output to be prettier by default

More exciting examples (the ones I have are a bit boring)

Sort out imshow
